And then you had a few people in the, uh, little village that were the banker, or\nthe mercantile, or the drugist, which was like a pharmacy. Um, then with the, uh, Chamber of\nCommerce, when- when, things started happening in [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME],\n[COMMUNITY NAME] is very close to [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME]. So when IRS, the\nUS government, uh, Internal Revenue Service came to [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME],\nsome women started working in [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME], the [TEXAS\nUNIVERSITY NAME], they would go there to work. And that was when it started evolving into two\nfamilies to support, um, the, um the family. And then when IBM, uh, came on [CENTRAL TEXAS\nREGION'S CITY AREA LOCATION], that was another significant boost for [COMMUNITY NAME]\nbecause it was located on the north side of [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY NAME], [\nCONSTRUCTION NOISE] And, uh, uh again, that was a location that, uh, many of the, the women\nwent to work. Uh, then the chamber kind of ,uh, transformed in recent years, probably about, uh, a\ndecade ago, uh, that, uh, live here, work here. Okay, so instead of being a commuter, uh, city, where\npeople would go someplace to work, the, the thought process was to develop jobs live here, work here,\nplay here. And so that's what, uh, it has transformed into, uh, also. Uh, uh, even as much as a grocery\nstore. Uh, I can remember where every new HEB was one was at [COMMUNITY SHOPPING\nCENTER], okay,[CENTRAL REGION CITY COMMUNITY CENTER], then [ANOTHER NEIGHBORING\nCITY] got an HEB and, uh, then even as far out of [CENTRAL COMMUNITY REGION CITY NAME]\nstart growing out to [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION'S CITY AREA LOCATION] was the safe way. And so\nit was a big deal when HEB finally came to [COMMUNITY NAME] that we can actually shop here for\nour groceries. And of course, uh, uh Walmart was the, uh on, [COMMUNITY AREA LOCATION] was kind of the, um, magnet that then transformed where we started getting other, uh corporate, um, entities\nlike, you know, eventually we would get Target, Home Depot, Best Buy and those things. So now you\ncan actually shop here. Uh, so you can live here, your work, shop here, play here, and you can do\neverything within [COMMUNITY NAME]."

And so that was again, bringing different\npeople together. We didn't know each other, but we walked together and we sang together. Uh, so I'm,\nI'm hoping to maybe get something going like a gospel sing or something in the park. But uh, I think,\nuh, we have a, uh, I'm on the school board too. We have the school district, the big field, which could\nbe a community gathering place to have um, not as not a secular, uh, or- or specific religion, but have\nan event where, um, people could know what the different groups are, uh, showcased the different\ncultures, whatever, those kinds of things, but it takes, it takes resources, both, uh, human resources to\nplan it, and monetary resources to fund it. And then to get the people to be involved. But I think we\nhave right now so many new people and they're just there and again, part of it's from the pandemic\nwhere they're not necessarily community oriented, they're just simply themselves and work related.\nOkay. And then whatever their joy is, you know, uh, so it's not necessarily building. They're not\ncommunity builders yet, and we need to find a way to bring more community builders and to whatever\nwe got."

So, I relate to all generations\nand and feel comfortable talking about. As a school board trustee that goes beyond just the city\nbecause the school district is like 96 square miles, as opposed to the city, which itself, the city has\n80,000. But people and the school district probably has somewhere between 250 300,000 now. Okay, so, uh, trying to be a listen to the stakeholders, whether their parents or their business people or thier\nthe teachers, the workforce, uh, what-what's happening, who's coming to town? uh, that's important, I\nthink, for the school to know that. But, uh, uh, again, from the workforce thing, it's-it's changing\nsignificantly. Because, again, as I, uh, said, with the volunteers, another component was the school\nwas the core, everybody went to school activities. That's how [COMMUNITY NAME]'s name was\npromoted throughout the state and our students going nationally to competitions, they would know\nwhere [COMMUNITY NAME] is, okay. Now, uh, and we used to be a fast growth district, you know,\nfrom one high school to four high schools,uh, we now have 35, 36 campuses. But what's happening is\nnow, uh, with there's a changing paradigm on public education, and, um, so that is a, uh, wha, uh,\nbeyond our control, and we have charter schools that are coming in. And so that is again, separating\ncommunity, because when we were the only district, people within their neighborhoods would go to that\nschool, be in the PTO, go to the Little League games, um, you know, etc. And know one another and\ndo whatever. And when you have the charter schools are, uh, there's not that many private schools,\nthere's a few, but the homeschooling then that house, you have a different groups and they don't\ninterconnect, so that we're losing that unity. And again, one of the strengths of our community has\nbeen, uh, a good school system academically and with extracurricular activities, because we've always\npromoted, uh, excellence in whatever we do. So our students, whether they're in debate are if they are\nin athletics, or fine arts span, uh, theater of whatever they're doing, even from elementary school to\nspelling bee, you know, they do and they excel, and we need to, uh, amplify that and, uh, let our\ncommunity know that good things are happening."

If\nthere's anything that needs to be done, then I have to think about, you know, um the policies, uh, if we\nget regular updates on things that might be happening with safety and security.

And so everybody\nhas different priorities. But for me, uh, again, because [BACKGROUND CONSTRUCTION NOISE] of\nmy journey, um, I realized that the basic education we have to teach the four core things of history,\nscience, english and math, and uh, the extracurricular activities are important, but they're not the major\nthing. They help you develop, but how many people are going to pursue playing the trumpet for the rest\nof their life, or their part in the musical or um, their captain of the football team, or tennis, those are so\nvaluable because I did the same thing in high school, I was, um, on a basketball team varsity from ninth\nto 12th grade. And so it develops the character and the discipline and responsibility. If I would love to\nsee a policy where every child in secondary school has to belong to something, whether it's a club, or\nan activity of some sort, because it's what's beyond the academics. But if we falter on the academics,\nthen shame on us, we have not done what we need to do for that child, even though the child doesn't\nwant to do it. And even though the parents might say, This is too hard, you have to stretch. And that's\nthe I don't know, I think that's the important thing. I think, I, uh, public education is so vital for our\ncountry, and for the individual."

That means like kickstart, or we have to cut, um, um tutorials\nor things. So it's putting a lot of responsibility onto parents to step up. And for the student to be\nresponsible, and to work harder. Um, And we've um, advocated, we've gone to the state capitol, to our\nlegislators to talk about how, um, funding is so important. Uh, because again, with the pandemic, uh, in\nthe mindset of, uh, I would, I would say it's the pandemic, but it could be the mindset of different cultures too, I don't know that I haven't investigated, but it's like, oh, \"I don't feel like going to school\ntoday. So therefore, I'm gonna stay at home.\" Or \"I have one little trickle and, you know, I'm kind of\ncold, I can't go,\" okay. When they don't go we don't get money. So that means we have to cut programs\nare even and it's across the board. It's not just people always focus on the economically disadvantaged\nor certain groups. This is across the board with your middle class and people who do have money.\nThey'll say, \"Oh, well, we can take our kids out of school today and go on vacation, because they're\nsmart enough they're gonna catch up anyways.\" Well, that's good for them, but it's impacting what we\ncan do, and that's, um, that's probably the biggest challenge. The other thing, uh, other than money that\nis happening right now is so many, uh, the workforce, teachers are leaving teaching. And, um, when I\nlike to talk to people, as you're investigating and doing research, we don't really know exactly why. But\nthe more you talk and get an exit interview, it's not the salary. It's the student discipline, and the parents\nthat are just, uh giving, you know, they can't teach, they're more like babysitters. And it's, it's, we've got,\nI don't know how we swing that back, you know, uh because it's, but thankfully, you know, we have the\nstudents who will excel and the supportive parents who do make it happen. And it's a team, I always\ncall it like a tripod, it used to be called a milk stool, three prongs, you have, you have the school, the\nstudent and the parent, and if they can all be, again, united are on the same page working towards the\nsame goal rolling together, then you're going to have success. But if you lose one of those pegs to that\nchair, you know, and there's a lot of mental illness that's going on right now. And part of that, again, is\num, uh the family unit, uh, the supportive thing with extended, whether it's your religious community\nsupporting you, or our community, again, at large, you know, we've talked about, you know, the\nnetworking, you know, when you have aunts and uncles, or you have neighbors, or you have a a group\nof friends, but if they're on a certain channel, you know, think tank you, you lose some synergy and\nenergy,"

Okay. Uh, obviously roads\nand transportation because roads used to go by property lines, and they were narrow, and the farmers\ncould take their equipment on the roads, and manage. What's happened now as the farmers have been\npushed out, there are no farmers around anymore. Okay, there's just, they can't even move their\nequipment on the road. Uh-uh, I think we talked about the, um, uh-uh the number of shops here used to\nthere was not that you would have the town of party years ago, it had, um, probably three, they called\nthem beer joints or saloons, okay, places, and then you have the post office and you had the bank. And\nthen you had, um, that was about maybe a hairdresser. So anything that you wanted to purchase\nbeyond that, uh in the first big, the Circle C see was the first one, not a Circle K. But it's where the uh\n[COMMUNITY STREET NAME], that was a big thing when it came because that was the first\nconvenience store. So it was open nearly all hours. Uh, another thing that happened was in downtown\n[COMMUNTIY NAME], the current Shell Station kind of across from the fire department, when that\ncame in, it was attrusive, it was just so big with all the lights, I can remember when that was the first\nsignal light, right there, you know, red, green, or whatever it because there were no lights so, uh, and\nthe change is today, if you try to drive by HEB with [COMMUNTIY STREET NAME] and [COMMUNITY\nSTREET NAME] , the new design, people get so confused, there's have been some wreck. So\ntransportation has changed, and our shopping has changed. Uh, and, again, um-uh, knowing people,\nyou know who make the decisions and just knowing people, it's it's, uh it that's changed significantly.\nThey have the neighborhood night out, which started probably again, uh, as the town grew in the last\nprobably 20 years. And so at least neighborhoods attempt to get together, but I don't in the, you know,\nour police forces expanded significantly, because with more growth comes more investigations and\nsecurity is important and crimes. You know, uh, we've had several big crimes that were you know,\n[COMMUNITY NAME] for I'll never, it was like a black eye, you know, like the bomber, or if you\nremember that about three years ago, the bomber actually lived in [COMMUNITY NAME], when he you\nknow that they, they were they couldn't figure out who was doing all of that. And it was like crazy. You\nknow that? Nobody knew that that could even happen here. Nobody knew the person. And he had\nbeen in the barber shop here and live close to the [COMMUNITY CLUB]"

And so\nthat the same thing is, from the school point of view, we will always educate any child that comes\nthrough the door of our school. But when you ha-, if people have a home, they usually stay here, they\nbecome involved in the community. If our students are here, from K through 12, we kind of know where\nthey are and how they're doing and how they can amplify [BACKGROUND CONSTRUCTION NOISE].\nUh, If they come in through an, uh you know, again, the multi housing, they might be here for two\nmonths, two years, forever, we don't know.

So it was a destination for families. If I were a young\nfamily today, and we're looking at [COMMUNITY NAME], I would have to question I would have to\nponder, you know, are those schools what I want is their unity and community and the availability of the\nthings that I need. [BACKGROUND CONSTRUCTION NOISE] Because what I'm seeing now is people\nwho have lived here for a while, if they can sell their property, they're moving to the outside, uh, smaller\ncommunities, because that was the kind of life that they had desired. Another big change, I will say, and\nthis is global now, okay, it's not just community. But [COMMUNITY NAME] was, uh, my- my [CHAIR\nSOUND] ancestors were the [COMMUNITY ANCESTOR NAME]. Okay. So they came from\n[EUROPEAN COUNTRY NAME] emigrated, didn't know the language didn't know the call the-the to\nraise crops [BACKGROUND CONSTRUCTION NOISE] that they became farmers. And so the [COMMUNITY PRAIRE], everybody who goes through Texas schools has to take Texas geography and I think middle school I don't know if you did that in seventh or eighth grade, you had to take."

Uh, and then in the wintertime, you, um, you\nbutchered your uh pigs or your beef because that was your food, you didn't go to the grocery store to\nget, you bake your bread. Okay, so when we had, going to church, going to school was a big deal. That\nwas important, because that's when we got to see other children and play with other children. So that\nwas really good. Uh, and then with my own children for their childhood, I wanted them to again, be\ninvolved in things. So they were in Four H, and FFA Future Farmers of America. So they they raised like uh, a steer our a lamb, our chickens, uh etc. We didn't do pigs because I did pigs, and I didn't want to do pigs again. So that and then like for us, uh, to read books, even. We didn't have a library in [COMMUNITY NAME]. So the bookmobile from [CENTRAL TEXAS REGION CITY NAME] came about\nonce a month, and we could check out books, it would stop.

Uh, But I go back to again, with\nmusic and play the piano. So I liked, I liked all of the decades, uh the 20s to 30s because I didn't live\ndown but I played the music. Uh, as far as listening. I still, uh, I was an Elvis Presley, 60s that's, I think\nwhat you hear in high school becomes what you identify with. Okay. And so, uh, but again, um, I I've\nembraced modern music, um, whether, uh, usually it goes more by a group or, uh an individual like,\nokay, I-I in Willie Nelson or Johnny Cash or Kenny Rogers or whether it's some of the Beatles songs or\nNeil Diamond, uh, so I-I think across the generic on that, um-um but I'm definitely not, um, not not a\nrapper are, you know, I don't know, if you do line dancing. You know, that's kind of that's kind of a\ngroup thing, um, yeah, I. And I definitely have a problem with, [THINKS] songs are written music is\nwritten, depending upon the writer having experienced, uh, like, a lot of country western songs used to\nbe DIVO or CE, you know, or lost love, you know, they've had something's gone wrong. So that's, that's\nhow they work through it. It's a therapy, and they write the songs. But when the songs get to be, again,\nvulgar, and not the right use of words, it goes back to my core values of respect and a while some\nlanguages now they accept words that have implications. Um, I just, it's part of our culture. And it's part\nof their culture, but it doesn't have to be me."

As part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief\npassage, which should only take a couple of minutes in it is a short made up story about life in Texas,\nthat was created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans\nreading it. They use these recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking as they tried to\ntrack how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage\nout loud? Yes. Great. Thank you so much. And whenever you are ready, [FLIPPING PAPER] could you\nplease read this page out loud?"

I like growing up in the country. When my chores were\ndone, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. [COUGHS] One time we\ntied a rope to a limb of the cypress tree and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into\nthe water. I prefer to be Tarzan swinging on a vine.[COUGHS AND DRINKS WATER] In the spring, I'd\nfly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while\nwe'd have flights with corn cobs and or pine cones. In the winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and\npop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was alive while when I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got, mama would always cook our favorite foods fried okra, hop and John. That's rice and black eyed peas in pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama\nsold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of hearing the city, but\nmy wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country.\nMy oldest child says daddy, \" That's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first\ntime she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots.\nWhile we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the lamb. Have a sense of place\nand take pride in being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high."
